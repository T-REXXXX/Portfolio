<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Erfindung der Wahrheit</h3>
<p>I love Jessica Chastain in her role and how the film builds up.</p>
<h3>Die Geisha</h3>
<p>A motivating story and beautiful aestetics.</p>
<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</h3>
<p>Ridiculously funny at first, unexpected heartbreaking at the end.</p>
